"""Local admission PREVIEW — see your bot clear the safety bar in ~10 seconds.

    python preview.py                          # previews agent.py
    python preview.py example_sector_rotation.py

No engine, no network, no keys, no install — pure standard library. It runs your
bot across three real, PUBLIC market windows (a calm uptrend, a mild selloff, and
the 2020 COVID vol-spike + snapback) and prints the same shape of report the real
admission email gives you, plus a verdict on the safety bar admission actually gates on.

What this DOES tell you, definitively:
  • Your bot runs clean (no crash) on real data.
  • It respects the live limits: gross leverage <= 1.5x, no single position >= 30%.
  • It doesn't blow up (>50% drawdown).
Those three are exactly what admission checks — and they depend on YOUR logic, not on
which window we use. So if you clear them here, you're very likely to be admitted.

What it does NOT tell you: your official numbers. Real admission runs centrally on
hidden historical regimes so it's identical for everyone. The Sharpe/Calmar/return
below are on sample windows — illustrative, not your score. The 60-day live forward
test is what actually ranks you.
